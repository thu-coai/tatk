# Task-oriented Dialog System Toolkits
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thu-coai/tatk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thu-coai/tatk) 

TaTk is an open-source task-oriented dialog system toolkits developed by Tsinghua University Conversational AI group (THU-coai). We provide several models for each module in dialog system, as well as some joint models and end-to-end models. It's easy to combine the modules to build a dialog system and replace some modules with yours to evaluate them in system level. Further more, user simulator (policy for user agent) is provided for system policy training. Our unified agent definition also supports symmetric agents for negotiation dialog and multiple agents for multiparty dialog.

Features included:

- Complete and configurable framework for task-oriented dialog system.
- Pre-trained models on Multiwoz, Camrest, Dealornot dataset.
- Simple interfaces for adapting your models.
- Rule simulators on Multiwoz and Camrest dataset for RL policy training.
- Unified agent definition which allows customized dialog scene such as multiparty dialog.

This project is a part of ``thutk`` (Toolkits for Dialog System by Tsinghua University), you can follow [thutk](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/thutk/) or 
[tatk](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/thutk/tatk/) on our home page. Some code are shared with [Convlab](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab).
