TaTk is an open-source task-oriented dialog system toolkits developed by Tsinghua University Conversational AI group (THU-coai). We provide implementations for each module in dialog system, as well as some joint models and end-to-end models. Further more, user simulator is provided for dialog policy training. It's easy to combine the modules to build a dialog system and replace some modules with yours to evaluate them in system level.

Main Features:

- Complete and configurable framework for task-oriented dialog system.
- Easy to follow interfaces for implementing your modules.
- Pre-trained models on Multiwoz dataset.
- Smooth interaction with user simulator.
