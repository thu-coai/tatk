# Sequicity

Sequicity is an end-to-end task-oriented dialog system based on a single sequence-to-sequence model that uses *belief span* to track dialog believes. 

- It formulates the DST task into a generation problem (rather than the classification problem)
- It tracks the dialog history using *two-state copynet* mechanism, one for *belief span*, the other for response generation.

We adapt the code from [github](https://github.com/WING-NUS/sequicity) to work in multiwoz corpus. The original paper can be found at [ACL Anthology](https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P18/P18-1133).

## Prepare data

To prepare the data for Sequicity, you need to download data and unzip in `[dataset]` dir. Please refer to `[dataset]` subdirectory for details.

## Training with default parameters

```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode train -model [dataset] -cfg [dataset]/configs/[dataset].json
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode adjust -model [dataset] -cfg [dataset]/configs/[dataset].json
```

## Testing

```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode test -model [dataset] -cfg [dataset]/configs/[dataset].json
```

## Reinforcement fine-tuning

```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode rl -model [dataset] -cfg [dataset]/configs/[dataset].json
```

## Trained model

Please refer to `[dataset]` subdirectory for details.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **BLEU4**

- **Match rate** : determines if a system can generate all correct constraints (belief span) to search the indicated entities of the user

- **Success F1**: F1 score of requested slots answered in the current dialogue

Please refer to `[dataset]` subdirectory for performance result. In terms of `success F1`,  Sequicity by order shows the (F1, Precision, Recall) score.

## Predict

```python
from tatk.e2e.sequicity.[dataset] import Sequicity

s = Sequicity(model_file=MODEL_PATH_OR_URL)
s.response("I want to find a cheap restaurant")
```
