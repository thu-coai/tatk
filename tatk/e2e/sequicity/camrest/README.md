# Sequicity on camrest

Sequicity is an end-to-end task-oriented dialog system based on a single sequence-to-sequence model that uses *belief span* to track dialog believes. We adapt the code from [github](https://github.com/WING-NUS/sequicity) to work in multiwoz corpus.  The original paper can be found at [ACL Anthology](https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P18/P18-1133)

## Prepare data

To prepare the data for Sequicity, you need to download [data](https://tatk-data.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/sequicity_camrest_data.zip) and unzip in `sequicity/camrest` dir.

## Training with default parameters

Go to `sequicity` dir,

   ```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode train -model camrest -cfg camrest/configs/camrest.json
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode adjust -model camrest -cfg camrest/configs/camrest.json
   ```

   ## Testing

   ```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode test -model camrest -cfg camrest/configs/camrest.json
   ```

   ## Reinforcement fine-tuning

   ```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=../../../../.. python model.py -mode rl -model camrest -cfg camrest/configs/camrest.json
   ```

## Trained model

Trained model can be download on [here](https://tatk-data.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/sequicity_camrest.pkl). Place it under `sequicity/camrest/output` dir.


## Predict

```python
from tatk.e2e.sequicity.camrest import Sequicity

s = Sequicity(model_file=MODEL_PATH_OR_URL)
s.response("I want to find a cheap restaurant")
```
